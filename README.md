A simple library for getting live departure boards from the National Rail Enquiries Darwin service (via OpenLDBWS). Designed to wrap the SOAP code with a simple interface. Currently a work in progress.

To run this code you will need your own access token which you have to get from National Rail Enquiries.

If you're not in the UK or not interested in train data from the UK, this code probably won't help you.

## Important
National Rail Enquiries is the data provider for the API which this code wraps. However, this library is not approved, endorsed or supported by National Rail Enquiries.
